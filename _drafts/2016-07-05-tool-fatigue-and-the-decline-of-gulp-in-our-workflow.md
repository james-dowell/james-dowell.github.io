As part of a forward thinking team at UVD, I'm no stranger to tool fatigue and the frustrations that go with it. Having 10+ (at least) gulp plugins running all manor of tasks from, SCSS compiling, template cache generation, test running to Typescript compilation.

Many of us are used to composing large Gulpfile's or Gruntfile's to perform build and development tasks as we build projects, but recently I've been utilising the power of `npm` scripts to run tools straight from the command line.

Using `npm` scripts is nothing new, there are a number of articles that detail how powerful they can be, and why we should all be using them.

What we used to do..

What we do now (with a karma & typescript example)

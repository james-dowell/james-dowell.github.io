In this article I'll be touching upon what a styleguide / pattern-library is and why they're really useful for both new and existing projects.

## What is a Styleguide / Pattern Library



### Composite design vs Atomic design


Nucleus is a stylguide tool/generator developer by the 'Pirates' at HolidayPirates to generate a living styleguide. Styleguides, or pattern libraries as they are sometimes known, are really useful tools for building out and styling views or components for both SPA (Single Page Applications) and traditional websites alike. In this article I'm going to touch up what Styleguides are, why they are useful and how Nucleus is the best incarnation yet of a living Styleguide.


### Alright, so what does a living styleguide mean?

The age of problem of styleguide is that they can rapidly become out of date. While you might start a project by building partials in the stylguide and styling them with SCSS. When it comes to porting them over to where you need them you ultimately end up having to maintain two sets of the same HTML and inevitably the markup in the styleguide becomes outdated. This is where they really start to lose there value.

The ideology of a living styleguide is the idea that your markup can be shared between the styleguide and the application its used within. Therefore it evolves and changes as you develop the application and is updated at the same rate. This can be really useful in the design of future features as a designer can easily see what components are already available and can be included with relative ease into a new feature/design.

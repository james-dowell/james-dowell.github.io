Over the past two years I have been plying my trade and learning the ropes at a small but knowledgable tech firm named [UVD][uvd-site] in Shoreditch, London. During that time I've learned a few things and I'm hoping to share some of that knowledge through this blog.

Furthermore, I'm hoping that discussing a range of front-end topics help improve my knowledge in those areas and perhaps encourage others to get involved with front-end development.

If I am fortunate to have any readers then I'd encourage anyone to comment (probably to correct my mistakes!) on my posts.

Over the past few years I have gained vital experience working within the tech industry. Learning a number of new technologies and practices to ultimately make me the well rounded developer I am today. I have a good appreciation for user experience that has been nurtured while working within a great, forward thinking team at UVD.

## Technologies

When initially starting out in the industry JavaScript was my main focus. I began by improving on the basics that I had learnt at university, followed by developing some Angular 1.x projects.

- Angular/Angular2
- React
- ReduxJS
- TypeScript
- JavaScript ES5/6/+
- NodeJS
- HTML5
- CSS/SCSS
- Gulp/NPM
- Python

## Testing

Testing has been a huge part of every project I have worked on. So much so that I have never worked on a project, personal or professional, that I haven't approached from a TDD, (Test Driven Development) perspective. At UVD we also took a BDD, (Behaviour Driven Development) approach to some projects, using technologies such as CucumberJS and Behat with Selenium to create End to End tests. Listed below are just some the technologies/testing frameworks that I have used in the past:

- Karma
- Mocha
- Chai
- Sinon
- Chai-as-promised
- CucumberJS
- Behat
- Istanbul/Remap-Istanbul

## Experience

    <h3>UVD</h3>

    <small>June 2014 - present</small>

    <p>
        I've grown a lot since I first started at UVD. Coming fresh out of university meant that I was ready to be moulded into any developer I wanted to be. After a number of years, constantly learning new things and pushing the limitations of the latest front-end technologies, I have developed my skills to a high standard.

    <p>
        My time at LBG medical saw me involved in a number of roles within the company. Over this placement I spent large portions of time learning and developing technologies which I then used to build a number of web experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most notably building an e-learning platform which is still being used today by biomechanical practitioners. I also got involved with the business side and was open vocal in my ideas for marketing within the company, both web and offline.
    </p>

    <h4>Responsibilities</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Development of websites for the LBG Medical group
        </li>
        <li>
            Coming up with innovative marketing strategies to help drive growth within the business.
        </li>
        <li>
            Development of an e-learning platform to help build marketing leads (Something I did from scratch, without a framework - I was young and naive!).
        </li>
    </ul>

## Personal

On a personal note, some of my hobbies include ...

I have also been involved in producing/recording a number of podcasts with some of the team at UVD. Initially starting out as the UVD podcast, which later transformed into End2End FM. We covered a wide range of topics from user experience to front-end and backend development technologies.
